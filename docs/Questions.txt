Generative AI in Medicine and Healthcare
What is Generative Artificial Intelligence?
Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a type of AI that creates new content, such as text, images, or audio, based on patterns learned from existing data.

How is Generative AI used in medicine?
Generative AI is used in medicine for clinical documentation, decision support, patient engagement, medical imaging, synthetic data generation, and medical education.

What is Hippocratic AI?
Hippocratic AI is a generative AI model designed for patient engagement, focusing on providing empathetic and safe healthcare communication without making medical diagnoses.

What challenges does Generative AI face in healthcare?
Challenges include trust issues, data privacy concerns, regulatory hurdles, AI bias, and lack of transparency in decision-making.

Can Generative AI replace doctors?
No, Generative AI is meant to assist healthcare professionals by improving efficiency and patient engagement, but it cannot replace human expertise in medical decision-making.

How is Generative AI different from traditional AI?
Traditional AI focuses on tasks like classification and decision-making, while Generative AI creates new content by modeling data distributions and generating realistic outputs​
.

What are some common applications of Generative AI?
Generative AI is used in text generation (e.g., ChatGPT), image creation (e.g., Stable Diffusion), video synthesis, music composition, software development, and scientific research such as drug discovery​
.

What are the main challenges of Generative AI?
The key challenges include bias in training data, lack of transparency, hallucinations (incorrect AI-generated content), misuse (e.g., deepfakes), and societal concerns such as job displacement​
.

How does Generative AI impact businesses?
Businesses use Generative AI for automation, content creation, customer support, and marketing, enabling faster workflows and innovative services but also raising ethical and legal concerns

What is RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)?
RAG is a technique that enhances language models by combining them with a retrieval system, allowing them to use external knowledge sources to generate more accurate and contextually relevant responses​
.

What are the key technical components of RAG?
RAG involves data preparation (chunking, embeddings), input processing (query expansion, named entity recognition), retrieval (search, multi-step retrieval, re-ranking), and answer generation (context window management, optimization, safety checks)​
.

What is chunking in RAG?
Chunking involves breaking large documents into smaller pieces for easier retrieval and processing, reducing cost and improving efficiency​
.

What are embeddings in RAG?
Embeddings convert text and metadata into numerical representations, helping the model find relevant content more effectively during retrieval​
.

How can RAG responses be optimized?
Responses can be optimized using prompt engineering, few-shot examples, fine-tuning, and safety checks to ensure accuracy and relevance​
